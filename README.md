# PneumoniaCT_CV
PneumoniaCT - Object Recognition and Segmentation (U-net &amp; YOLOv8)

## Overview:
Medical image recognition project:
1. Use computer vision to help check lung part in CT and identify and segment the pneumonia zone.
2. Data format: CT -> NIFTI (Nii)
3. Model Architecture: U-net & YOLOv8 (with comparison)
4. Demonstration: multi modal dataset (nii to json/txt/png), object recognition and segmentation model

## Achievements:
Fusion: Multi modal and Hybrid models
Successfully completed model building, trainng and evaluation, and then the model can be integrated into a scenario-specific system,
e.g., medical system software, intranet, specific medical equipment and etc. -> for secondary development
